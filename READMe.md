## Godot with Express

I'm making Godot as a front end UI served by Node.js & Express for it's back end.
In time I will have something that can play with user data either an implementation of MongooseDB 
...or maybe something else for a DataBase.

For now I'm happy to be able to make a client web page served with the Godot Game Engine.
