Thank you for downloading my first published app!

I originally made this app for myself and to show during an interview, or add to my resume. This is a tool to help make better decisions about what to eat. 

Photograph what you eat, score it with checkmarks on the form, give it a unique name, and save it. Then you can review all your meals and pics like a menu and decide from there.

If this app goes well, I will build on it and develope it further. For now I just hope this app can help me find an internship as a programmer.
