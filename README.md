## Godot with Express

Welcome to my repo

I'm making Godot as a front end UI served by Node.js & Express for it's back end.
In time I will have something that can play with user data either an implementation of MongooseDB 
...or maybe something else for a DataBase.

For now I'm happy to be able to make a client web page served with the Godot Game Engine.

the directories, web projects and godot projects contain code from past things I've done, however the directory 'client' under the godot projects is a copy for the UI of my current project.
